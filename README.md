# Sage.js

**Sage.js** is the reference implementation for Sage, a query-based data exchange protocol for APIs, created at [dorkodu](https://dorkodu.com).

> #### `Note`
>
> The **Sage.js** project is a *work-in-progress*.
> Code and documentation are currently under development and are subject to change.

## Overview

In any project that you use Sage, you'll need client/server libraries which manages your data requirements, handles queries, networking and the remote/local states of your data.

This is where **Sage.js** shines!

## Features

- #### Declarative & effective data fetching for Sage

  -   Simply manage your data requirements.
      -   Describe your app’s data requirements as queries; anywhere, anytime.
      -   Satisfy them with the data your Sage API returns.
      -   Keep the data fresh.
  -   Write a single query and receive data without manually tracking loading states.

- #### Universally Compatible

  -   Use any build setup and any Sage API.
  -   Isomorphic.
  -   Runs on most browsers.
  -   No other dependencies.
  -   TypeScript support.

## Getting Started

A general overview of Sage is available on the [repository frontpage](https://github.com/dorkodu/sage).
That overview describes a simple set of examples and more advanced topics.
A good way to get started with the Sage protocol is the [specification document](https://github.com/dorkodu/sage).
